#to add terminal commands to cmd

1) Install Git in your computer - https://git-scm.com/downloads.

2) After installing Git, go to the folder in which Git is installed. Mostly it will be in C drive and then Program Files Folder.

3) In Program Files folder, you will find the folder named Git, find the bin folder which is inside usr folder in the Git folder.

In my case, the location for bin folder was - C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin

4) Add this location (C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin) in path variable, in system environment variables.

5) You are done. Restart cmd and try to run ls and other Linux commands.
